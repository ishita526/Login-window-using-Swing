# Login-window-using-Swing
This is a mini project in Java using Swing. 

Aim/objective: To design a login screen using AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) in Java where:
1. The program takes username and password input from the user.
2. It validates the login credentials, allowing 3 login attempts.
3. If the username and password are not the same, an exception is raised with an appropriate
message.
4. The Clear button resets the text fields.
